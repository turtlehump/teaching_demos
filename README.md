# Coding Demos

This directory is meant to give you the basics of coding so you can create you own, simple programs. I put lots of comments in the code so please look at the source code as well as what is going on during the execution for the best understanding. I will start off with assuming you know nothing about programming. Like math, you should make sure you have complete understanding of a section before you move on to the next. There is no way I could ever explain every single little topic or concept about programming, so if you run into problems that I havent covered then you should google them. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the go-to resource for pretty much all programmers.

I recommend you start with [C++](https://github.com/turtlehump/teaching_demos/tree/master/c%2B%2B), it has a good mix of pre-made libraries that will do a lot of helpful tasks for you while not abstracting everything complicated and making it seem like "magic" is happening. If you start off with a language like Ruby, you will never learn how the black-box functions work and you will be stuck having to accept all the "magic" because you wouldnt know how to make it yourself. Ruby is efficient enough with todays computers but if you want to crunch 1Tb of numbers then you will want to use C++ to make a custom program where you can be sure you are doing the task the most efficient way.

This tutorial is meant to go with either a Linux computer or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) on a Windows computer:
* get new/update packages on Linux with "apt-get" directly in terminal
* get new/update packages on Cygwin with the setup_x86.exe
* [Terminal Cheat Sheet](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf)

Here are some basic packages that you will need to get started no matter what language you are trying to learn:
* git: Distributed version control system (this will allow you to get my code on your computer, or share your own code)
* vim: Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor (so you can edit plain text files within terminal)
  * for help, type "vimtutor" in terminal
  * [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)

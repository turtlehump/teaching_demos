# Objects

* ***If you are making a C++ program and not drawing pictures, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG***

* C++ is an Object Oriented (00) Language. This means that everything is separated into classes and further seperated in subclasses.
* A subclass inherits everything from a super class and then has extras that makes it different from the superclass and all its other sisterclasses.

**Order of places to look and description:**
1. **vectors.cpp**: Shows you how a vector works. A vector is like an array that can grow depending on your data.
2. **videos**: This will give you a template for making your own basic, stand alone classes.

# C++

C++ was developed in the late 70's and is still used today. It's one of the fastest languages out there and is used in very time sensitive systems (self driving cars, space travel, etc.). A programmer has complete control of the program when using C++, but that also means that nothing is done for you automatically. C++ is a good starter language because it forces you to learn how everything works and you wont take easier languages with lots of "magic" for granted afterwards.

**Order of places to look at and description:**
1. **intro**: The place to start if you dont know anything about C++ or programming.
2. **objects**: More abstract concepts. We will start creating our own objects.
3. **advanced_objects**: Start making objects that are used to solve broad problems.

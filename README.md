# Coding Demos

This directory is meant to give you the basics of coding so you can create you own, simple programs. I put lots of comments in the code so please look at the source code as well as what is going on during the execution for the best understanding. I will start off with assuming you know nothing about programming. Like math, you should make sure you have complete understanding of a section before you move on to the next. There is no way I could ever explain every single little topic or concept about programming, so if you run into problems that I havent covered then you should google them. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the go-to resource for pretty much all programmers.

This tutorial is meant to go with either a Linux computer or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) on a Windows computer:
* get new/update packages on Linux with "apt-get" directly in terminal
* get new/update packages on Cygwin with the setup_x86.exe
* [Terminal Cheat Sheet](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf)

Here are some basic packages that you will need to get started no matter what language you are trying to learn:
* git: Distributed version control system (this will allow you to get my code on your computer, or share your own code)
* vim: Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor (so you can edit plain text files within terminal)
  * for help, type "vimtutor" in terminal
  * [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)

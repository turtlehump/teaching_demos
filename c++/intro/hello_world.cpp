  //  easily figure out whats going on.
  //* Code is run a billion times, read a thousand times, and written once.
  //* Since this is a teaching demo, I will be using a lot of comments to explain
  //  what things do. It is in your best intrest to read all the comments.

  //* "cout" is how you output text to the terminal in C++.
  //* This example uses a hard coded string, but you can output variables too.
  //* "endl" = end line. This will put you at the start of a new line of text.
